</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">You</span> stranger, long before your glance can light</div>
<div class="verse">Upon these words, time will have washed away</div>
<div class="verse">The moment when I first took pen to write,</div>
<div class="verse">With all my road before me—yet to-day,</div>
<div class="verse">Here, if at all, we meet; the unfashioned clay</div>
<div class="verse">Ready to both our hands; both hushed to see</div>
<div class="verse">That which is nowhere yet come forth and be.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>2</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This moment, if you join me, we begin</div>
<div class="verse">A partnership where both must toil to hold</div>
<div class="verse">The clue that I caught first. We lose or win</div>
<div class="verse">Together; if you read, you are enrolled.</div>
<div class="verse">And first, a marvel—Who could have foretold</div>
<div class="verse">That in the city which men called in scorn</div>
<div class="verse">The Perfect City, Dymer could be born?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>3</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There you’d have thought the gods were smothered down</div>
<div class="verse">Forever, and the keys were turned on fate.</div>
<div class="verse">No hour was left unchartered in that town,</div>
<div class="verse">And love was in a schedule and the State</div>
<div class="verse">Chose for eugenic reasons who should mate</div>
<div class="verse">With whom, and when. Each idle song and dance</div>
<div class="verse">Was fixed by law and nothing left to chance.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>4</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For some of the last Platonists had founded</div>
<div class="verse">That city of old. And mastery they made</div>
<div class="verse">An island of what ought to be, surrounded</div>
<div class="verse">By this gross world of easier light and shade.</div>
<div class="verse">All answering to the master’s dream they laid</div>
<div class="verse">The strong foundations, torturing into stone</div>
<div class="verse">Each bubble that the Academy had blown.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>5</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This people were so pure, so law-abiding,</div>
<div class="verse">So logical, they made the heavens afraid:</div>
<div class="verse">They sent the very swallows into hiding</div>
<div class="verse">By their appalling chastity dismayed:</div>
<div class="verse">More soberly the lambs in springtime played</div>
<div class="verse">Because of them: and ghosts dissolved in shame</div>
<div class="verse">Before their common-sense—till Dymer came.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>6</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At Dymer’s birth no comets scared the nation,</div>
<div class="verse">The public crèche engulfed him with the rest,</div>
<div class="verse">And twenty separate Boards of Education</div>
<div class="verse">Closed round him. He was passed through every test,</div>
<div class="verse">Was vaccinated, numbered, washed and dressed,</div>
<div class="verse">Proctored, inspected, whipt, examined weekly,</div>
<div class="verse">And for some nineteen years he bore it meekly.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>7</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For nineteen years they worked upon his soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Refining, chipping, moulding and adorning.</div>
<div class="verse">Then came the moment that undid the whole—</div>
<div class="verse">The ripple of rude life without a warning.</div>
<div class="verse">It came in lecture-time one April morning</div>
<div class="verse">—Alas for laws and locks, reproach and praise,</div>
<div class="verse">Who ever learned to censor the spring days?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>8</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A little breeze came stirring to his cheek.</div>
<div class="verse">He looked up to the window. A brown bird</div>
<div class="verse">Perched on the sill, bent down to whet his beak</div>
<div class="verse">With darting head—Poor Dymer watched and stirred</div>
<div class="verse">Uneasily. The lecturer’s voice he heard</div>
<div class="verse">Still droning from the dais. The narrow room</div>
<div class="verse">Was drowsy, over-solemn, filled with gloom.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>9</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He yawned, and a voluptuous laziness</div>
<div class="verse">Tingled down all his spine and loosed his knees,</div>
<div class="verse">Slow-drawn, like an invisible caress.</div>
<div class="verse">He laughed—The lecturer stopped like one that sees</div>
<div class="verse">A Ghost, then frowned and murmured, “Silence, please.”</div>
<div class="verse">That moment saw the soul of Dymer hang</div>
<div class="verse">In the balance—Louder then his laughter rang.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>10</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The whole room watched with unbelieving awe,</div>
<div class="verse">He rose and staggered rising. From his lips</div>
<div class="verse">Broke yet again the idiot-like guffaw.</div>
<div class="verse">He felt the spirit in his finger-tips,</div>
<div class="verse">Then swinging his right arm—a wide ellipse</div>
<div class="verse">Yet lazily—he struck the lecturer’s head.</div>
<div class="verse">The old man tittered, lurched and dropt down dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>11</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Out of the silent room, out of the dark</div>
<div class="verse">Into the sum-stream Dymer passed, and there</div>
<div class="verse">The sudden breezes, the high hanging lark</div>
<div class="verse">The milk-white clouds sailing in polished air,</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly flashed about him like a blare</div>
<div class="verse">Of trumpets. And no cry was raised behind him.</div>
<div class="verse">His class sat dazed. They dared not go to find him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>12</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet wonderfully some rumour spread abroad—</div>
<div class="verse">An inarticulate sense of life renewing</div>
<div class="verse">In each young heart—He whistled down the road:</div>
<div class="verse">Men said: “There’s Dymer”—“Why, what’s Dymer doing?”</div>
<div class="verse">“I don’t know”—“Look, there’s Dymer,”—far pursuing</div>
<div class="verse">With troubled eyes—A long mysterious “Oh”</div>
<div class="verse">Sighed from a hundred throats to see him go.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>13</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Down the white street and past the gate and forth</div>
<div class="verse">Beyond the wall he came to grassy places.</div>
<div class="verse">There was a shifting wind to West and North</div>
<div class="verse">With clouds in heeling squadron running races.</div>
<div class="verse">The shadows following on the sunlight’s traces</div>
<div class="verse">Crossed the whole field and each wild flower within it</div>
<div class="verse">With change of wavering glories every minute.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>14</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There was a river, flushed with rains, between</div>
<div class="verse">The flat fields and a forest’s willowy edge.</div>
<div class="verse">A sauntering pace he shuffled on the green,</div>
<div class="verse">He kicked his boots against the crackly sedge</div>
<div class="verse">And tore his hands in many a furzy hedge.</div>
<div class="verse">He saw his feet and ankles gilded round</div>
<div class="verse">With buttercups that carpeted the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>15</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He looked back then. The line of a low hill</div>
<div class="verse">Had hid the city’s towers and domes from sight;</div>
<div class="verse">He stopt: he felt a break of sunlight spill</div>
<div class="verse">Around him sudden waves of searching light.</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the earth was green, and gold, and white</div>
<div class="verse">Smothering his feet. He felt his city dress</div>
<div class="verse">An insult to that April cheerfulness.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>16</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He said: “I’ve worn this dust heap long enough,</div>
<div class="verse">Here goes!” And forthwith in the open field</div>
<div class="verse">He stripped away that prison of sad stuff:</div>
<div class="verse">Socks, jacket, shirt and breeches off he peeled</div>
<div class="verse">And rose up mother-naked with no shield</div>
<div class="verse">Against the sun: then stood awhile to play</div>
<div class="verse">With bare toes dabbling in cold river clay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>17</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Forward again, and sometimes leaping high</div>
<div class="verse">With arms outspread as though he would embrace</div>
<div class="verse">In one act all the circle of the sky:</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes he rested in a leafier place,</div>
<div class="verse">And crushed the wet, cool flowers against his face:</div>
<div class="verse">And once he cried aloud, “Oh world, oh day,</div>
<div class="verse">Let, let me,”—and then found no prayer to say.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>18</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Up furrows still unpierced with earliest crop</div>
<div class="verse">He marched. Through woods he strolled from flower to flower,</div>
<div class="verse">And over hills. As ointment drop by drop</div>
<div class="verse">Preciously meted out, so hour by hour</div>
<div class="verse">The day slipped through his hands: and now the power</div>
<div class="verse">Failed in his feet from walking. He was done,</div>
<div class="verse">Hungry and cold. That moment sank the sun.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>19</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He lingered—Looking up, he saw ahead</div>
<div class="verse">The black and bristling frontage of a wood</div>
<div class="verse">And over it the large sky swimming red</div>
<div class="verse">Freckled with homeward crows. Surprised he stood</div>
<div class="verse">To feel that wideness quenching his hot mood,</div>
<div class="verse">Then shouted, “Trembling darkness, trembling green,</div>
<div class="verse">What do you mean, wild wood, what do you mean?”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>20</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He shouted. But the solitude received</div>
<div class="verse">His noise into her noiselessness, his fire</div>
<div class="verse">Into her calm. Perhaps he half believed</div>
<div class="verse">Some answer yet would come to his desire.</div>
<div class="verse">The hushed air quivered softly like a wire</div>
<div class="verse">Upon his voice. It echoed, it was gone:</div>
<div class="verse">The quiet and the quiet dark went on.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>21</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He rushed into the wood. He struck and stumbled</div>
<div class="verse">On hidden roots. He groped and scratched his face.</div>
<div class="verse">The little birds woke chattering where he fumbled.</div>
<div class="verse">The stray cat stood, paw lifted, in mid-chase.</div>
<div class="verse">There is a windless calm in such a place.</div>
<div class="verse">A sense of being indoors—so crowded stand</div>
<div class="verse">The living trees, watching on every hand:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>22</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A sense of trespass—such as in the hall</div>
<div class="verse">Of the wrong house, one time, to me befell.</div>
<div class="verse">Groping between the hatstand and the wall—</div>
<div class="verse">A clear voice from above me like a bell,</div>
<div class="verse">The sweet voice of a woman asking “Well?”</div>
<div class="verse">No more than this. And as I fled I wondered</div>
<div class="verse">Into whose alien story I had blundered.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>23</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A like thing fell to Dymer. Bending low,</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling his way he went. The curtained air</div>
<div class="verse">Sighed into sound above his head, as though</div>
<div class="verse">Stringed instruments and horns were riding there.</div>
<div class="verse">It passed and at its passing stirred his hair.</div>
<div class="verse">He stood intent to hear. He heard again</div>
<div class="verse">And checked his breath half-drawn, as if with pain.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>24</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">That music could have crumbled proud belief</div>
<div class="verse">With doubt, or in the bosom of the sage</div>
<div class="verse">Madden the heart that had outmastered grief,</div>
<div class="verse">And flood with tears the eyes of frozen age</div>
<div class="verse">And turn the young man’s feet to pilgrimage—</div>
<div class="verse">So sharp it was, so sure a path it found,</div>
<div class="verse">Soulward with stabbing wounds of bitter sound.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>25</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It died out on the middle of a note,</div>
<div class="verse">As though it failed at the urge of its own meaning.</div>
<div class="verse">It left him with life quivering at the throat,</div>
<div class="verse">Limbs shaken and wet cheeks and body leaning,</div>
<div class="verse">With strain towards the sound and senses gleaning</div>
<div class="verse">The last, least, ebbing ripple of the air,</div>
<div class="verse">Searching the emptied darkness, muttering “Where?”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>26</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then followed such a time as is forgotten</div>
<div class="verse">With morning light, but in the passing seems</div>
<div class="verse">Unending. Where he grasped the branch was rotten,</div>
<div class="verse">Where he trod forth in haste the forest streams</div>
<div class="verse">Laid wait for him. Like men in fever dreams</div>
<div class="verse">Climbing an endless rope, he laboured much</div>
<div class="verse">And gained no ground. He reached and could not touch.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
<div class="verse"><h3>27</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And often out of darkness like a swell</div>
<div class="verse">That grows up from no wind upon blue sea,</div>
<div class="verse">He heard the music, unendurable</div>
<div class="verse">In stealing sweetness wind from tree to tree.</div>
<div class="verse">Battered and bruised in body and soul was he</div>
<div class="verse">When first he saw a little lightness growing</div>
<div class="verse">Ahead: and from that light the sound was flowing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>28</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The trees were fewer now: and gladly nearing</div>
<div class="verse">That light, he saw the stars. For sky was there,</div>
<div class="verse">And smoother grass, white flowered—a forest clearing</div>
<div class="verse">Set in seven miles of forest, secreter</div>
<div class="verse">Than valleys in the tops of clouds, more fair</div>
<div class="verse">Than greenery under snow or desert water</div>
<div class="verse">Or the white peace descending after slaughter.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><h3>29</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As some who have been wounded beyond healing</div>
<div class="verse">Wake, or half wake, once only and so bless</div>
<div class="verse">Far off the lamplight travelling on the ceiling.</div>

<div class="verse">“So mortal and so brave?” that other said,</div>

<div class="verse">Scanning him over twice from heel to head</div>

<div class="verse">To know the points of men. At last, “Arise,”</div>

<div class="verse">Said Dymer: and the other, “Soon now, soon.</div>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
